# bueno Run Scripts for Proxies

This repository is part of the [bueno project](https://github.com/lanl/bueno).
It contains the source code of bueno run scripts for proxy applications of
interest to LANL.  Because of potential licensing incompatibilities, we keep
associated proxy source code in a separate, private repository. Individuals with
access to LANL's GitLab may request proxy source code access by sending the
maintainers of the bueno project an email. Those individuals without such access
must recreate a similar, compatible file structure from source code of their
agglomeration; we provide examples to ease in this process.
